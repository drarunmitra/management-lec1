## P-O-L-C Framework

![](images/ploc_framework2.png)


# Planning

- Definition: Setting objectives and determining the best way to achieve them
- Importance: Provides direction and reduces uncertainty
- Steps: Analysis, goal setting, action plan, implementation, evaluation
- Continuous process with feedback loops

Planning requires that managers be aware of environmental conditions facing their organization and forecast future conditions. It also requires that managers be good decision makers.

## Process of Planning

1. **Environmental Scanning**: Planners must be aware of critical contingencies facing their organization, such as economic conditions, competitors, and customers.
2. **Forecasting**: Planners attempt to forecast future conditions, forming the basis for planning.
3. **Establishing Objectives**: Objectives are statements of what needs to be achieved and when.
4. **Identifying Alternatives**: Planners identify alternative courses of action for achieving objectives.
5. **Decision Making**: Planners evaluate alternatives and make decisions about the best courses of action.
6. **Formulating Steps**: Planners formulate necessary steps and ensure effective implementation of plans.
7. **Evaluating Success**: Planners constantly evaluate the success of their plans and take corrective action when necessary.

## Types of Planning

- **Strategic Planning**: Analyzing competitive opportunities and threats, strengths and weaknesses of the organization, and determining how to position the organization effectively. It has a long time frame, often three years or more.
- **Tactical Planning**: Intermediate-range planning (one to three years) designed to develop concrete means to implement the strategic plan.
- **Operational Planning**: Short-range planning (less than a year) specifying ways to achieve organization-wide or subunit goals and objectives.



## Organizing

- Definition: Arranging resources and tasks to achieve objectives
- Importance: Ensures efficient use of resources
- Key elements: Division of labor, delegation, coordination

- Role of organizational charts in clarifying roles


## Organizational Structure
- Framework within which effort is coordinated.
- Represented by an organization chart.
- Decisions about the structure are organizational design decisions.

## Job Design
- Involves decisions about duties, responsibilities, and manner of carrying out tasks.
- Organizational decisions about jobs are referred to as “job design” decisions.

## Departmentalization
- Involves deciding how to cluster jobs into departments.
- Methods include organizing by function, product, geography, or customer.
- Larger organizations often use multiple methods.

## Designing Individual Jobs
- Traditional approach based on division of labor and specialization.
- Recent trend towards balancing specialization with variety and autonomy.
- Principles include empowerment, job enrichment, and teamwork.

# Staffing

- Recruiting, selecting, and training personnel
- Ensures right people in right jobs
- Importance: Maintaining a competent workforce

- Role of HR in healthcare staffing

<br>

- Example: Hiring and training nurses

# Directing (Leading)

- Leading, motivating, and communicating with employees
- Importance: Guides team efforts towards achieving goals

- Effective communication and leadership
- Ensuring team efficiency and morale

Leading involves the social and informal sources of influence that you use to inspire action taken by others. 

## Contributions of Behavioral Sciences
- **Personality Research**: Understanding subordinates' personalities, values, attitudes, and emotions is crucial for effective leadership.
- **Motivation Theory**: Provides insights into energizing workers to put forth productive effort.
- **Communication Studies**: Offer direction on effective and persuasive communication.
- **Leadership Studies**: Address questions about what makes a manager a good leader and when certain leadership styles are most appropriate and effective.

# Controlling

- Monitoring and adjusting ongoing activities
- Importance: Ensures goals are being met, corrective actions taken
- Steps: Establish standards, measure performance, compare with standards, take corrective action

- Use of performance metrics to assess outcomes

## Controlling Process
- It consists of three steps: 
  1. Establishing performance standards
  2. Comparing actual performance against standards
  3. Taking corrective action when necessary.

## Performance Standards
- Often stated in monetary terms (e.g., revenue, costs, profits) or other terms (e.g., units produced, quality levels).
- Measurement methods include financial statements, sales reports, production results, customer satisfaction, and performance appraisals.

## Managerial Function vs. Behavioral Control
- Controlling in management does not imply manipulation of subordinates' personalities, values, attitudes, or emotions.
- Instead, it focuses on ensuring work-related activities align with organizational objectives.

## Relationship with Planning
- Effective controlling requires clear performance standards provided by planning.
- It also requires understanding responsibility for deviations from standards.

## Control Techniques
- Traditional techniques include budget and performance audits.
- Audits involve examination and verification of records and documents.

## Scope of Controlling
- Goes beyond financial criteria to include production, operations, service delivery, and compliance with company policies.



# Feedback

- Definition: Information about the results of actions taken, used as a basis for improvement

- Importance: Ensures continuous improvement and adaptation

- Sources: Internal (staff, internal audits) and external (patients, regulatory bodies)

- Enhancing decision-making and fostering a culture of continuous improvement

Feedback is essential for personal and professional growth.
- It helps individuals understand their strengths and areas for improvement.

## Types of Feedback
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provides specific suggestions for improvement in a supportive manner.
- **Positive Feedback**: Acknowledges and reinforces desirable behavior or outcomes.
- **Negative Feedback**: Highlights areas for improvement or corrective action.

## Principles of Effective Feedback
- **Timeliness**: Feedback should be provided promptly after the observed behavior.
- **Specificity**: Feedback should be clear, specific, and focused on behavior rather than personality.
- **Balance**: Include both positive and negative feedback to provide a well-rounded perspective.
- **Actionable**: Feedback should be actionable, providing concrete steps for improvement.
- **Respectful**: Feedback should be delivered respectfully, maintaining dignity and professionalism.

## Giving Feedback
- **Be Prepared**: Organize your thoughts and observations before providing feedback.
- **Be Objective**: Base feedback on observable behaviors and facts rather than assumptions or opinions.
- **Be Constructive**: Offer solutions and suggestions for improvement rather than criticism.
- **Be Receptive**: Encourage dialogue and listen to the recipient's perspective.

## Receiving Feedback
- **Be Open-Minded**: Approach feedback with a willingness to learn and grow.
- **Seek Clarification**: If feedback is unclear, ask for specific examples or further explanation.
- **Focus on Improvement**: Use feedback as an opportunity for self-reflection and growth.
- **Express Appreciation**: Thank the giver for their feedback, regardless of its nature.
